      "abstract": "Dynamic race detection based on the happens before (HB) partial order has now\nbecome the de facto approach to quickly identify data races in multi-threaded\nsoftware. Most practical implementations for detecting these races use\ntimestamps to infer causality between events and detect races based on these\ntimestamps. Such an algorithm updates timestamps (stored in vector clocks) at\nevery event in the execution, and is known to induce excessive overhead. Random\nsampling has emerged as a promising algorithmic paradigm to offset this\noverhead. It offers the promise of making sound race detection scalable. In\nthis work we consider the task of designing an efficient sampling based race\ndetector with low overhead for timestamping when the number of sampled events\nis much smaller than the total events in an execution. To solve this problem,\nwe propose (1) a new notion of freshness timestamp, (2) a new data structure to\nstore timestamps, and (3) an algorithm that uses a combination of them to\nreduce the cost of timestamping in sampling based race detection. Further, we\nprove that our algorithm is close to optimal -- the number of vector clock\ntraversals is bounded by the number of sampled events and number of threads,\nand further, on any given dynamic execution, the cost of timestamping due to\nour algorithm is close to the amount of work any timestamping-based algorithm\nmust perform on that execution, that is it is instance optimal. Our evaluation\non real world benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed\nalgorithm over prior timestamping algorithms that are agnostic to sampling.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes StreamCodec, a streamable neural audio codec designed for\nreal-time communication. StreamCodec adopts a fully causal, symmetric\nencoder-decoder structure and operates in the modified discrete cosine\ntransform (MDCT) domain, aiming for low-latency inference and real-time\nefficient generation. To improve codebook utilization efficiency and compensate\nfor the audio quality loss caused by structural causality, StreamCodec\nintroduces a novel residual scalar-vector quantizer (RSVQ). The RSVQ\nsequentially connects scalar quantizers and improved vector quantizers in a\nresidual manner, constructing coarse audio contours and refining acoustic\ndetails, respectively. Experimental results confirm that the proposed\nStreamCodec achieves decoded audio quality comparable to advanced\nnon-streamable neural audio codecs. Specifically, on the 16 kHz LibriTTS\ndataset, StreamCodec attains a ViSQOL score of 4.30 at 1.5 kbps. It has a fixed\nlatency of only 20 ms and achieves a generation speed nearly 20 times real-time\non a CPU, with a lightweight model size of just 7M parameters, making it highly\nsuitable for real-time communication applications.",

      "abstract": "We provide novel insight into causal inference when both treatment spillover\nand outcome spillover occur in connected populations, by taking advantage of\nrecent advances in statistical network analysis. Scenarios with treatment\nspillover and outcome spillover are challenging, because both forms of\nspillover affect outcomes and therefore treatment spillover and outcome\nspillover are intertwined, and outcomes are dependent conditional on treatments\nby virtue of outcome spillover. As a result, the direct and indirect causal\neffects arising from spillover have remained black boxes: While the direct and\nindirect causal effects can be identified, it is unknown how these causal\neffects explicitly depend on the effects of treatment, treatment spillover, and\noutcome spillover. We make three contributions, facilitated by low-rank random\ninterference graphs. First, we provide novel insight into direct and indirect\ncausal effects by disentangling the contributions of treatment, treatment\nspillover, and outcome spillover. Second, we provide scalable estimators of\ndirect and indirect causal effects. Third, we establish rates of convergence\nfor estimators of direct and indirect causal effects. These are the first\nconvergence rates in scenarios in which treatment spillover and outcome\nspillover are intertwined and outcomes are dependent conditional on treatments,\nand the interference graph is sparse or dense.",

To address these issues, we define\nfour effect estimands for dyadic data to characterize direct effects and\nspillover effects. We employ dual instrumental variables to achieve\nnonparametric identification of these causal estimands in the presence of\nunobserved confounding.

While an existing method for egocentric\nwhole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and\nacausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture\ncorrelations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and\nreal-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded\nbody-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between\negocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2)\ndiffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a\nsingle denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified\nTransformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while\nenhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND\noptionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior\nis available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method\nbased on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further\nenhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both\nwith and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.",

      "abstract": "Causal inference is often portrayed as fundamentally distinct from predictive\nmodeling, with its own terminology, goals, and intellectual challenges. But at\nits core, causal inference is simply a structured instance of prediction under\ndistribution shift. In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source\ndomain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not\nobserved. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels --\npotential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment,\nintroducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective\nreframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights\nhow techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain\nadaptation, apply directly to causal tasks. It also clarifies that causal\nassumptions are not uniquely strong -- they are simply more explicit. By\nviewing causal inference through the lens of prediction, we demystify its\nlogic, connect it to familiar tools, and make it more accessible to\npractitioners and educators alike.",

While previous studies have\nprimarily focused on its association with total particulate matter (PM2.5), the\ncausal relationship between wildfire smoke and the chemical composition of\nPM2.5 remains largely unexplored. Exposure to these chemical mixtures plays a\ncritical role in shaping public health, yet capturing their relationships\nrequires advanced statistical methods capable of modeling the complex\ndependencies among chemical species.

By focusing on factor scores, our method\naddresses the missing data challenge common in causal inference and enables a\nflexible, data-driven characterization of the latent factor structure, which is\ncrucial to capture the complex correlation among multivariate outcomes. Through\nMonte Carlo simulations, we show the model's accuracy in estimating the causal\neffects in multivariate outcomes and characterizing the treatment-specific\nlatent structure.
