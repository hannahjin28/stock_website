      "abstract": "Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands\nmodels that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and\ncalibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however,\nexhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they\nstruggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static\nregularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal\nBoosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance\nregularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function\nof gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the\nregularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the\nbias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets\nand real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\nimproves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true\ntreatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method\nsuccessfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy\nin treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic\nregularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive\nperformance and model interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the\ncontrol mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by\ncomponents such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the\ncritical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of\nNDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we\nadvocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop\nsystem and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging\nthe gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively\ndecoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we\ndesign a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system\nmatrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is\nstable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to\nrecover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period\nguarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph\nproperties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the\nconcerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ\ninverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function\ndriving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that\naddresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental\nvariables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends\nprevious work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates\nnon-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than\nexisting methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to\nupdate models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this\nmodel selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model\nuncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and\nprovides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments,\ngIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

This disconnect between\ncausal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain\nexperts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal\nresearchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods.\nTo address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that\noperationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model\nframework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for\nboth tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal\ninference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result\ninterpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive\nrefinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists\nwhile preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art\ncausal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding\naccess to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich,\nreal-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance\ncompared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible\nsolution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world\napplicability in causal analysis.",

      "abstract": "In causal inference, remarkable progress has been made in\ndifference-in-differences (DID) approaches to estimate the average effect of\ntreatment on the treated (ATT). Of these, the semiparametric DID (SDID)\napproach incorporates a propensity score analysis into the DID setup. Supposing\nthat the ATT is a function of covariates, we estimate it by weighting the\ninverse of the propensity score. As one method to make the estimation robust to\nthe propensity score modeling, we incorporate covariate balancing. Then, by\nattentively constructing the moment conditions used in the covariate balancing,\nwe show that the proposed estimator has doubly robustness. In addition to the\nestimation, model selection is also addressed. In practice, covariate selection\nis an essential task in statistical analysis, but even in the basic setting of\nthe SDID approach, there are no reasonable information criteria. Therefore, we\nderive a model selection criterion as an asymptotically bias-corrected\nestimator of risk based on the loss function used in the SDID estimation. As a\nresult, we show that a penalty term is derived that is considerably different\nfrom almost twice the number of parameters that often appears in AIC-type\ninformation criteria. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method\nestimates the ATT robustly compared to the method using propensity scores given\nby the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and that the proposed criterion\nclearly reduces the risk targeted in the SDID approach compared to the\nintuitive generalization of the existing information criterion. In addition,\nreal data analysis confirms that there is a large difference between the\nresults of the proposed method and the existing method.",

We employ modern causal inference methods to estimate\nnot only the local average treatment effect but also its time-varying and\nheterogeneous effects across regions. Utilizing this method, we propose a novel\nframework for evaluating the effectiveness of CF as an EU cohesion policy tool.\nSpecifically, we estimate the time varying distribution of the CF's causal\neffects across EU regions and derive key distribution metrics useful for policy\nevaluation. Our analysis shows that relying solely on average treatment effects\nmasks significant heterogeneity and can lead to misleading conclusions about\nthe effectiveness of the EU's cohesion policy. We find that the impact of the\nCF is frontloaded, peaking within the first seven years after a region's\ninitial inclusion in the program. The distribution of the effects during this\nfirst seven-year cycle of funding is right skewed with relatively thick tails.\nThis indicates positive effects but unevenly distributed across regions.\nMoreover, the magnitude of the CF effect is inversely related to a region's\nrelative position in the initial distribution of output, i.e., relatively\npoorer recipient regions experience higher effects compared to relatively\nricher regions. Finally, we find a non-linear relationship with diminishing\nreturns, whereby the impact of CF declines as the ratio of CF funds received to\na region's gross value added (GVA) increases.",
