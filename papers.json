      "abstract": "The impact of wildfire smoke on air quality is a growing concern,\ncontributing to air pollution through a complex mixture of chemical species\nwith important implications for public health. While previous studies have\nprimarily focused on its association with total particulate matter (PM2.5), the\ncausal relationship between wildfire smoke and the chemical composition of\nPM2.5 remains largely unexplored. Exposure to these chemical mixtures plays a\ncritical role in shaping public health, yet capturing their relationships\nrequires advanced statistical methods capable of modeling the complex\ndependencies among chemical species. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian\ncausal regression factor model that estimates the multivariate causal effects\nof wildfire smoke on the concentration of 27 chemical species in PM2.5 across\nthe United States. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) a causal\ninference framework for multivariate potential outcomes, and (ii) a novel\nBayesian factor model that employs a probit stick-breaking process as prior for\ntreatment-specific factor scores. By focusing on factor scores, our method\naddresses the missing data challenge common in causal inference and enables a\nflexible, data-driven characterization of the latent factor structure, which is\ncrucial to capture the complex correlation among multivariate outcomes. Through\nMonte Carlo simulations, we show the model's accuracy in estimating the causal\neffects in multivariate outcomes and characterizing the treatment-specific\nlatent structure. Finally, we apply our method to US air quality data,\nestimating the causal effect of wildfire smoke on 27 chemical species in PM2.5,\nproviding a deeper understanding of their interdependencies.",

      "abstract": "Micro-level data with granular spatial and temporal information are becoming\nincreasingly available to social scientists. Most researchers aggregate such\ndata into a convenient panel data format and apply standard causal inference\nmethods. This approach, however, has two limitations. First, data aggregation\nresults in the loss of detailed geo-location and temporal information, leading\nto potential biases. Second, most panel data methods either ignore spatial\nspillover and temporal carryover effects or impose restrictive assumptions on\ntheir structure. We introduce a general methodological framework for\nspatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects.\nUnder this general framework, we demonstrate how to define and estimate causal\nquantities of interest, explore heterogeneous treatment effects, investigate\ncausal mechanisms, and visualize the results to facilitate their\ninterpretation. We illustrate the proposed methodology through an analysis of\nairstrikes and insurgent attacks in Iraq. The open-source software package\ngeocausal implements all of our methods.",

      "abstract": "Who should we prioritize for intervention when we cannot estimate\nintervention effects? In many applied domains (e.g., advertising, customer\nretention, and behavioral nudging) prioritization is guided by predictive\nmodels that estimate outcome probabilities rather than causal effects. This\npaper investigates when these predictions (scores) can effectively rank\nindividuals by their intervention effects, particularly when direct effect\nestimation is infeasible or unreliable. We propose a conceptual framework based\non amenability: an individual's latent proclivity to be influenced by an\nintervention. We then formalize conditions under which predictive scores serve\nas effective proxies for amenability. These conditions justify using non-causal\nscores for intervention prioritization, even when the scores do not directly\nestimate effects. We further show that, under plausible assumptions, predictive\nmodels can outperform causal effect estimators in ranking individuals by\nintervention effects. Empirical evidence from an advertising context supports\nour theoretical findings, demonstrating that predictive modeling can offer a\nmore robust approach to targeting than effect estimation. Our framework\nsuggests a shift in focus, from estimating effects to inferring who is\namenable, as a practical and theoretically grounded strategy for prioritizing\ninterventions in resource-constrained environments.",

Although SS can be generally achieved using\noffline methods, such a processing paradigm is not suitable for real-time\nstreaming applications. Causal separation models, which rely only on past and\npresent information, offer a promising solution for real-time streaming.\nHowever, these models typically suffer from notable performance degradation due\nto the absence of future context. In this paper, we introduce a novel frontend\nthat is designed to mitigate the mismatch between training and run-time\ninference by implicitly incorporating future information into causal models\nthrough predictive patterns. The pretrained frontend employs a transformer\ndecoder network with a causal convolutional encoder as the backbone and is\npretrained in a self-supervised manner with two innovative pretext tasks:\nautoregressive hybrid prediction and contextual knowledge distillation. These\ntasks enable the model to capture predictive patterns directly from mixtures in\na self-supervised manner. The pretrained frontend subsequently serves as a\nfeature extractor to generate high-quality predictive patterns. Comprehensive\nevaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validated the effectiveness of\nthe proposed pretrained frontend.",

      "abstract": "Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge\nin causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area,\nmost existing methods assume the availability of fully specified causal graphs.\nHowever, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal\nknowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system\nis accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within\npartially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed\nmixed graphs (C-DMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of\ncausal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more\npractical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified causal\ngraphs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and\ninterpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new\nchallenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects, macro\ncausal effects and micro causal effects, with different properties. In this\nwork, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire\nclusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and\ncomplete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs. Additionally, we provide a\ngraphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in\nthese graphs.",

      "abstract": "When using the Cox model to analyze the effect of a time-varying treatment on\na survival outcome, treatment is commonly included, using only the current\nlevel as a time-dependent covariate. Such a model does not necessarily assume\nthat past treatment is not associated with the outcome (the Markov property),\nsince it is possible to model the hazard conditional on only the current\ntreatment value. However, modeling the hazard conditional on the full treatment\nhistory is required in order to interpret the results causally, and such a full\nmodel assumes the Markov property when only including current treatment. This\nis, for example, common in marginal structural Cox models. We demonstrate that\nrelying on the Markov property is problematic, since it only holds in\nunrealistic settings or if the treatment has no causal effect. This is the case\neven if there are no confounders and the true causal effect of treatment really\nonly depends on its current level. Further, we provide an example of a scenario\nwhere the Markov property is not fulfilled, but the Cox model that includes\nonly current treatment as a covariate is correctly specified. Transforming the\nresult to the survival scale does not give the true intervention-specific\nsurvival probabilities, showcasing that it is unclear how to make causal\nstatements from such models.",

      "abstract": "Predicting future events stands as one of the ultimate aspirations of\nartificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based\nsystems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby\ngarnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several\nbenchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by\nformalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and\nreasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with\nrelevant retrieved news articles. However, because there is no consideration on\nwhether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting\nrationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently\nnoninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET,\nwhich comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for\nretrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal\nIntervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability\nthrough causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected\nrecent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL,\nresulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction. Through extensive\nexperiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth\ninvestigations into event prediction with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we\nevaluate several representative prediction systems on PROPHET, drawing valuable\ninsights for future directions.",
