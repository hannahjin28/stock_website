      "abstract": "Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as\nneural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel\nat single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from\nsignal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent\njoint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely\nautoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they\nsacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for\nmeta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions\nfrom set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented\nconditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal\nautoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our\napproach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The\nmodel processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures\ntarget dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and\nattend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables\nefficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood\nevaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of\nset-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic\nfunctions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches\npredictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster\njoint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive\ngenerative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning,\nmaking joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.",

      "abstract": "Causal Machine Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for flexibly\nestimating causal effects from observational data in both industry and\nacademia. However, causal inference from observational data relies on\nuntestable assumptions about the data-generating process, such as the absence\nof unobserved confounders. When these assumptions are violated, causal effect\nestimates may become biased, undermining the validity of research findings. In\nthese contexts, sensitivity analysis plays a crucial role, by enabling data\nscientists to assess the robustness of their findings to plausible violations\nof unconfoundedness. This paper introduces sensitivity analysis and\ndemonstrates its practical relevance through a (simulated) data example based\non a use case at Booking.com. We focus our presentation on a recently proposed\nmethod by Chernozhukov et al. (2023), which derives general non-parametric\nbounds on biases due to omitted variables, and is fully compatible with (though\nnot limited to) modern inferential tools of Causal Machine Learning. By\npresenting this use case, we aim to raise awareness of sensitivity analysis and\nhighlight its importance in real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)\nunmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that\nconfound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments\nthat violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods\ntypically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply\nconnected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging\nthis insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that\nreconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates\ncausal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables\nnonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak\nassumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the\nlatent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial\nconfounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial\nDeconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets\nin environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a\nmulti-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures\nto advance robust causal inference in structured data.",

Recent literature\nproposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations\nof text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,\nbecause the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods\nrisk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,\ninducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we\nintroduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the\noverlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design\nin an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in\npolitical communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based\nmethods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text\nand outcomes from our experiment.

      "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future\ntrajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the\ninherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a\nstate-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two\ndenoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the\nlearning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to\nfacilitate further research.",

Here we analyze a metropolitan-scale heterogeneous dataset\nfor Indianapolis comprising 30,046 feeder-level outages between 2020 and 2024,\nlinked to smart meters and submetering, to quantify the causal impact of\nelectric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and distributed energy resources\n(DERs) on restoration surges. Statistical analysis and causal forest inference\ndemonstrate that rising penetrations of all three assets significantly increase\nsurge ratios, with effects strongly modulated by restoration timing, outage\nduration and weather conditions. We develop a component-aware multi-task\nTransformer estimator that disaggregates EV, HP and DER contributions, and\napply it to project historical outages under counterfactual 2035 adoption\npathways. In a policy-aligned pathway, evening restorations emerge as the\nbinding reliability constraint, with exceedance probabilities of 0.057 when\n30\\% of system load is restored within the first 15 minutes. Mitigation\nmeasures, probabilistic EV restarts, short thermostat offsets and accelerated\nDER reconnection, reduce exceedance to 0.019 and eliminate it entirely when\n20\\% or less of system load is restored.
