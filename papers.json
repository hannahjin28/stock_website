      "abstract": "Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care\nunit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the\navailability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and\ncosts associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience\nfrequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden\non both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel\nmethod that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to\nidentify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable\nOff-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)\ncreates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by\nconsidering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We\npose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward\nfunction derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning\nframework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge\nthe gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function\nprovides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting\nany vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior\napproaches to this practical problem.",

      "abstract": "Real-world vaccine effectiveness has increasingly been studied using\nmatching-based approaches, particularly in observational cohort studies\nfollowing the target trial emulation framework. Although matching is appealing\nin its simplicity, it suffers important limitations in terms of clarity of the\ntarget estimand and the efficiency or precision with which is it estimated.\nScientifically justified causal estimands of vaccine effectiveness may be\ndifficult to define owing to the fact that vaccine uptake varies over calendar\ntime when infection dynamics may also be rapidly changing. We propose a causal\nestimand of vaccine effectiveness that summarizes vaccine effectiveness over\ncalendar time, similar to how vaccine efficacy is summarized in a randomized\ncontrolled trial. We describe the identification of our estimand, including its\nunderlying assumptions, and propose simple-to-implement estimators based on two\nhazard regression models. We apply our proposed estimator in simulations and in\na study to assess the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to\nprevent infections with SARS-CoV2 in children 5-11 years old. In both settings,\nwe find that our proposed estimator yields similar scientific inferences while\nproviding significant efficiency gains over commonly used matching-based\nestimators.",

      "abstract": "Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive\nresults in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily\nintegrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,\nautoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a\nnatural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text\ngeneration, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image\ngeneration. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)\nguides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that\nthis order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image\ncontent: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an\nautoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color\nof clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this\nwork, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in\nany-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each\npatch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune\nthe any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our\nexperiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces\nbetter images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training\ncosts and no extra annotations.",

Recently, software testing\ntechniques based on causal inference have been successfully applied to systems\nthat exhibit such characteristics, including scientific models and autonomous\ndriving systems. One significant limitation is that these are restricted to\ntest properties where all of the variables involved can be observed and where\nthere are no interactions between variables. In practice, this is rarely\nguaranteed; the logging infrastructure may not be available to record all of\nthe necessary runtime variable values, and it can often be the case that an\noutput of the system can be affected by complex interactions between variables.\nTo address this, we leverage two additional concepts from causal inference,\nnamely effect modification and instrumental variable methods. We build these\nconcepts into an existing causal testing tool and conduct an evaluative case\nstudy which uses the concepts to test three system-level requirements of CARLA,\na high-fidelity driving simulator widely used in autonomous vehicle development\nand testing. The results show that we can obtain reliable test outcomes without\nrequiring large amounts of highly controlled test data or instrumentation of\nthe code, even when variables interact with each other and are not recorded in\nthe test data.",

It is\ntypically the case that patients with incomplete eligibility information are\nexcluded from analysis without consideration of (implicit) assumptions that are\nbeing made, leaving study conclusions subject to potential selection bias. In\nan effort to ascertain eligibility for more patients, researchers may look back\nfurther in time prior to study baseline, and in using outdated values of\neligibility-defining covariates may inappropriately be including individuals\nwho, unbeknownst to the researcher, fail to meet eligibility at baseline. To\nthe best of our knowledge, however, very little work has been done to mitigate\nthese concerns. We propose a robust and efficient estimator of the causal\naverage treatment effect on the treated, defined in the study eligible\npopulation, in cohort studies where eligibility-defining covariates are missing\nat random. The approach facilitates the use of flexible machine-learning\nstrategies for component nuisance functions while maintaining appropriate\nconvergence rates for valid asymptotic inference. EHR data from Kaiser\nPermanente are used as motivation as well as a basis for extensive simulations\nthat verify robustness properties under various degrees of model\nmisspecification.

Despite\nextensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial\ngaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive\nrationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive\ninterpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present\nChimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework\nto derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental\ndrivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and\naffective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional\nresponses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first\nincorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it\nextracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation)\nand fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates\nthem into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic).\nFinally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a\nlarge language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues\nevoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental\nresults on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as\nGPT-4o.

In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal\nBoosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance\nregularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function\nof gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the\nregularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the\nbias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets\nand real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\nimproves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true\ntreatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method\nsuccessfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy\nin treatment effect estimation.
