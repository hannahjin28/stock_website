      "abstract": "We propose a fully Bayesian approach for causal inference with multivariate\ncategorical data based on staged tree models, a class of probabilistic\ngraphical models capable of representing asymmetric and context-specific\ndependencies. To account for uncertainty in both structure and parameters, we\nintroduce a flexible family of prior distributions over staged trees. These\ninclude product partition models to encourage parsimony, a novel distance-based\nprior to promote interpretable dependence patterns, and an extension that\nincorporates continuous covariates into the learning process. Posterior\ninference is achieved via a tailored Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm with\nsplit-and-merge moves, yielding posterior samples of staged trees from which\naverage treatment effects and uncertainty measures are derived. Posterior\nsummaries and uncertainty measures are obtained via techniques from the\nBayesian nonparametrics literature. Two case studies on electronic fetal\nmonitoring and cesarean delivery and on anthracycline therapy and cardiac\ndysfunction in breast cancer illustrate the methods.",

      "abstract": "Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is\nfundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static\ncausal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where\nrelationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics\nrequires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning\nmethod for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler\nand Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic\nrepresentations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive\nDependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing\ndatapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits\na unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal\ncausality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human\nmotion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,\ntime-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Inferring the causal effects of time-varying treatments is often hindered by\nhighly variable inverse propensity weights, particularly in settings with\nlimited covariate overlap. Building on the key framework of Imai and Ratkovic\n(2015), we establish sufficient balancing conditions for identification in\nlongitudinal studies of treatment effects and propose a novel estimator that\ndirectly targets features of counterfactual or potential covariates. Instead of\nbalancing observed covariates, our method balances the components of covariates\nthat are orthogonal to their history, thereby isolating the new information at\neach time point. This strategy directly targets the joint distribution of\npotential covariates and prioritizes features that are most relevant to the\noutcome. We prove that the resulting estimator for the mean potential outcome\nis consistent and asymptotically normal, even in settings where standard\ninverse propensity weighting fails. Extensive simulations show that our\nestimator attains efficiency comparable to that of g-computation while\nproviding superior robustness to model misspecification. We apply our method to\na longitudinal study of private versus public schooling in Chile, demonstrating\nits stability and interpretability in estimating their effects on university\nadmission scores.",

An\nagentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM)\nplanner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within\ndata-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward.

Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core.\nIn this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular,\nthe possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field\n(RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics\n(MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different\nsets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model\nand the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase.\nWe impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray\nobservational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and\ncausality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also\nconstrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe\nobservational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase\ntransition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The\nMFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their\ninner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar\nmass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that\nthere is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars\nwith a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more\nmassive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed\nacross institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of\ndiscriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in\npart, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.\nCausal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,\ndiscrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of\nbiomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms\nrather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological\nfoundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal\nrepresentation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and\ncounterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating\nclinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,\ncancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological\nmonitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting\nprescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific\nCausal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with\nintegration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph\nneural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,\nincluding computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,\nvalidation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond\ncross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal\nterminology without rigorous evidentiary support.

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial\nand temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor\ngeneralization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in\ndynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent\nnon-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish\nspatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in\nnon-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority\nof EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution\nshifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the\ndynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution\nperspective.",

Causal inference, which focuses on\ndetermining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables\nrather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach\nfor inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure\ninference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be\nrepresented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at\nodds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,\nmaking these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.\nIn this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model\nfor Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a\nstable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to\ninfer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that\nSCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional\nregulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has\nirreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through\ntranscription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the\naccuracy and sensitivity of SCALD.
