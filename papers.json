      "abstract": "Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a\nfundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and\nreal-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer\nthat shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We\nexplore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer\narchitecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal\ncausal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to\nenable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle\nreal-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information\nwhile maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we\npropose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry\ngrounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model\nsupports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,\nFlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments\non various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model\nincreases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive\nperformance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wzzheng/StreamVGGT.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural\nnetwork-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural\nGranger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model\nand applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and\noutput to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder\nurothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in\nreconstructing gene regulatory networks.",

Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on\nevent types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of\nexogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these\nout-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address\nthis gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect\n(ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic\nRubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events\nof temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE\nestimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both\nlong-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating\nout-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under\nout-of-domain-augmented point processes.",

      "abstract": "When examining a contrast between two interventions, longitudinal causal\ninference studies frequently encounter positivity violations when one or both\nregimes are impossible to observe for some subjects. Existing weighting methods\neither assume positivity holds or produce effects that conflate interventions'\nimpacts on ultimate outcomes with their effects on intermediate treatments and\ncovariates. We propose a novel class of estimands -- cumulative cross-world\nweighted effects -- that weights potential outcome differences using propensity\nscores adapting to positivity violations cumulatively across timepoints and\nsimultaneously across both counterfactual treatment histories. This new\nestimand isolates mechanistic differences between treatment regimes, is\nidentifiable without positivity assumptions, and circumvents the limitations of\nexisting longitudinal methods. Further, our analysis reveals two fundamental\ninsights about longitudinal causal inference under positivity violations.\nFirst, while mechanistically meaningful, these effects correspond to\nnon-implementable interventions, exposing a core\ninterpretability-implementability tradeoff. Second, the identified effects\nfaithfully capture mechanistic differences only under a partial common support\nassumption; violations cause the identified functional to collapse to zero,\neven when the causal effect is non-zero. We develop doubly robust-style\nestimators that achieve asymptotic normality and parametric convergence under\nnonparametric assumptions on the nuisance estimators. To this end, we\nreformulate challenging density ratio estimation as regression function\nestimation, which is achievable with standard machine learning methods. We\nillustrate our methods through analysis of union membership's effect on\nearnings.",

These appear as\ndirected cycles in the common graphical representation of the models. However,\nthe presence of cycles entails difficulties such as the fact that models need\nno longer be characterized by conditional independence relations. As a result,\nlearning cyclic causal structures remains a challenging problem. In this paper,\nwe offer new insights on this problem in the context of linear non-Gaussian\nmodels. First, we precisely characterize when two directed graphs determine the\nsame linear non-Gaussian model. Next, we take up a setting of cycle-disjoint\ngraphs, for which we are able to show that simple quadratic and cubic\npolynomial relations among low-order moments of a non-Gaussian distribution\nallow one to locate source cycles. Complementing this with a strategy of\ndecorrelating cycles and multivariate regression allows one to infer a\nblock-topological order among the directed cycles, which leads to a {consistent\nand computationally efficient algorithm} for learning causal structures with\ndisjoint cycles.",

Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a\nclear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,\nensuring robust generalization.

Our approach\nmitigates common challenges in causal inference for vector-valued treatments,\nsuch as infeasible treatment combinations, stringent positivity assumptions,\nand interpretability concerns.

DyCAST-Net\neffectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated\nconvolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its\nattention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy\nand interpretability.

Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets\ndemonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as\nTCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation\nof causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in\nnoisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,\nuncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising\non consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial\nmarkets.
