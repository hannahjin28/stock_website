      "abstract": "This paper addresses a key limitation in existing counterfactual inference\nmethods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Current approaches assume a\nspecific causal model to make counterfactuals identifiable. However, there are\nusually many causal models that align with the observational and interventional\ndistributions of an MDP, each yielding different counterfactual distributions,\nso fixing a particular causal model limits the validity (and usefulness) of\ncounterfactual inference. We propose a novel non-parametric approach that\ncomputes tight bounds on counterfactual transition probabilities across all\ncompatible causal models. Unlike previous methods that require solving\nprohibitively large optimisation problems (with variables that grow\nexponentially in the size of the MDP), our approach provides closed-form\nexpressions for these bounds, making computation highly efficient and scalable\nfor non-trivial MDPs. Once such an interval counterfactual MDP is constructed,\nour method identifies robust counterfactual policies that optimise the\nworst-case reward w.r.t. the uncertain interval MDP probabilities. We evaluate\nour method on various case studies, demonstrating improved robustness over\nexisting methods.",

      "abstract": "Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) play a crucial role in optimizing digital\ninterventions. In an MRT, each participant is sequentially randomized among\ntreatment options hundreds of times. While the interventions tested in MRTs\ntarget short-term behavioral responses (proximal outcomes), their ultimate goal\nis to drive long-term behavior change (distal outcomes). However, existing\ncausal inference methods, such as the causal excursion effect, are limited to\nproximal outcomes, making it challenging to quantify the long-term impact of\ninterventions. To address this gap, we introduce the distal causal excursion\neffect (DCEE), a novel estimand that quantifies the long-term effect of\ntime-varying treatments. The DCEE contrasts distal outcomes under two excursion\npolicies while marginalizing over most treatment assignments, enabling a\nparsimonious and interpretable causal model even with a large number of\ndecision points. We propose two estimators for the DCEE -- one with\ncross-fitting and one without -- both robust to misspecification of the outcome\nmodel. We establish their asymptotic properties and validate their performance\nthrough simulations. We apply our method to the HeartSteps MRT to assess the\nimpact of activity prompts on long-term habit formation. Our findings suggest\nthat prompts delivered earlier in the study have a stronger long-term effect\nthan those delivered later, underscoring the importance of intervention timing\nin behavior change. This work provides the critically needed toolkit for\nscientists working on digital interventions to assess long-term causal effects\nusing MRT data.",

      "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification in causal inference settings with random network\ninterference is a challenging open problem. We study the large sample\ndistributional properties of the classical difference-in-means Hajek treatment\neffect estimator, and propose a robust inference procedure for the\n(conditional) direct average treatment effect, allowing for cross-unit\ninterference in both the outcome and treatment equations. Leveraging ideas from\nstatistical physics, we introduce a novel Ising model capturing interference in\nthe treatment assignment, and then obtain three main results. First, we\nestablish a Berry-Esseen distributional approximation pointwise in the degree\nof interference generated by the Ising model. Our distributional approximation\nrecovers known results in the literature under no-interference in treatment\nassignment, and also highlights a fundamental fragility of inference procedures\ndeveloped using such a pointwise approximation. Second, we establish a uniform\ndistributional approximation for the Hajek estimator, and develop robust\ninference procedures that remain valid regardless of the unknown degree of\ninterference in the Ising model. Third, we propose a novel resampling method\nfor implementation of robust inference procedure.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new Robust Disentangled Counterfactual Learning\n(RDCL) approach for physical audiovisual commonsense reasoning. The task aims\nto infer objects' physics commonsense based on both video and audio input, with\nthe main challenge being how to imitate the reasoning ability of humans, even\nunder the scenario of missing modalities. Most of the current methods fail to\ntake full advantage of different characteristics in multi-modal data, and\nlacking causal reasoning ability in models impedes the progress of implicit\nphysical knowledge inferring. To address these issues, our proposed RDCL method\ndecouples videos into static (time-invariant) and dynamic (time-varying)\nfactors in the latent space by the disentangled sequential encoder, which\nadopts a variational autoencoder (VAE) to maximize the mutual information with\na contrastive loss function. Furthermore, we introduce a counterfactual\nlearning module to augment the model's reasoning ability by modeling physical\nknowledge relationships among different objects under counterfactual\nintervention. To alleviate the incomplete modality data issue, we introduce a\nrobust multimodal learning method to recover the missing data by decomposing\nthe shared features and model-specific features. Our proposed method is a\nplug-and-play module that can be incorporated into any baseline including VLMs.\nIn experiments, we show that our proposed method improves the reasoning\naccuracy and robustness of baseline methods and achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly\ndetection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in\ndynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define\ntwo categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through\ninterconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to\nindividual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable\nCausality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic\nexplainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly\ndetection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to\nperform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are\nflagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly\ndetection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable\nframework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the\nunderlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships\nbetween variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in\nlearned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root\ncauses in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthe efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability\nto accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their\norigins.",

In contrast to previous studies that primarily focus on commonsense\ncausal reasoning, where LLMs often rely on prior knowledge for inference, we\nspecifically assess their ability to perform counterfactual inference using a\nset of formal rules. To support this evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark\ndataset, CounterBench, comprising 1K counterfactual reasoning questions. The\ndataset is designed with varying levels of difficulty, diverse causal graph\nstructures, distinct types of counterfactual questions, and multiple\nnonsensical name variants. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual\nreasoning poses a significant challenge for LLMs, with most models performing\nat levels comparable to random guessing. To enhance LLM's counterfactual\nreasoning ability, we propose a novel reasoning paradigm, CoIn, which guides\nLLMs through iterative reasoning and backtracking to systematically explore\ncounterfactual solutions.
